## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Setup your environement and install project dependencies.

```bash
# Any environment with python will work, but it's
# best practice to use some sort of virtual environment
# if you want control over python and external dependency versioning
$ conda create -n my_project python=3.10
$ source activate my_project

$ make venv
$ make preinstall
$ make precommit-setup
```

### Dependency Management

For development, track your dependencies in `requirements_dev.in` and install from there.

```bash
$ make install-dev
```

For production, track necessary dependencies in `requirements.in` and install from there.

```bash
$ make install-prod
```

## üîß Running the tests

Tests are implemented in ./tests, you need to run the following command to run them.

```
make tests
```

## üöÄ Deployment

The application can easily be built as a docker container and launched with docker compose. Before building and launching the docker container, you must specify the required environment variables in a `.env` file:

```js
SERVER_PORT=<port-number>
SERVICE_TOKEN=<random-hash>
```

Then you can use the makefile commands.

```bash
$ make docker-inspect   # examine whethehr the docker-compose template compiles properly
$ make docker-setup     # re-/build the container(s)
$ make docker-launch    # launch the container
```

To teardown the container:

```bash
$ make docker-teardown
```

**Note**: _The makefile commands assume the system is runnning the newest version of docker compose which has a slight different CLI API (`docker compose` vs `docker-compose`). If your production server is running an older version of docker compose, you should change the makefile docker commands to match your CLI._
